# Documentation Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic approach we'll take to build comprehensive documentation for ZionSync across four main files: Project.md, Technical.md, Troubleshooting.md, and Roadmap.md.

## Documentation Guidelines

### General Principles
- Only document verified features and functionality
- Request clarification for unclear code sections
- Include cross-references only when necessary
- Maintain consistent formatting within each document
- Version numbers will be included for Project.md, Technical.md, and Troubleshooting.md
- Have the user display all relevant files in a methodical order to complete Technical.md, then Project.md, then Troubleshooting.md, and finally Roadmap.md. Ask the user to show the relevant files again as you build each document file.

### File-Specific Guidelines

#### Project.md Structure
- Organize by main tabs (Presentation Team, Worship Team, A/V Team)
- Focus on functionality and features
- Keep explanations user-friendly but comprehensive

#### Technical.md Structure
- Document code architecture and relationships
- Include all relevant technical specifications
- Focus on helping developers understand the codebase

#### Troubleshooting.md Structure
- Separate user issues from development issues
- Include error codes and their resolutions
- Focus on practical solutions

#### Roadmap.md Structure
- Prioritize features and changes
- Include version milestones
- Track implementation workflows

## Development Process

1. **Initial Setup Phase**
   - Review each core file in the codebase
   - Create a list of all files to be documented
   - Establish file relationships and dependencies

2. **Documentation Creation Phase**
   For each core file:
   - Review code thoroughly
   - Document in Technical.md first
   - Add user-facing features to Project.md
   - Note potential issues in Troubleshooting.md
   - List improvement ideas in Roadmap.md

3. **File Processing Order**
   1. Core application files
   2. Component files
   3. Utility functions
   4. State management
   5. API interactions
   6. Styling and UI elements

4. **Review and Validation**
   - Verify all documented features
   - Cross-check technical details
   - Ensure accuracy of troubleshooting steps
   - Validate roadmap feasibility


## Next Steps

1. Share the core application files for initial review
2. Begin with the main application file
3. Document the primary navigation structure
4. Progress through each major component
